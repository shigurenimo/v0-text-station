# Test

Create only valuable and important tests. Basic tests that can be detected by type checking are not necessary.

- Do not create tests for files with side effects such as database operations
- Use only `test` and `expect` from `bun:test`
- Test titles should use Japanese
- Filename format is "*.test.ts"
